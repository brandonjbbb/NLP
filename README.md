Sentiment Analysis with spaCy and spacytextblob

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of textual data, such as customer reviews or social media posts. Using Python libraries like spaCy and spacytextblob, it provides a framework for sentiment categorization, data visualization, and extended insights. The project includes:

Key Features
Sentiment Categorization: Sentences are categorized into Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on polarity scores.
Polarity and Subjectivity Analysis: Each sentence is evaluated for polarity (sentiment intensity) and subjectivity, providing a nuanced look at the text.
Visualizations: Histograms display the distribution of polarity and subjectivity, offering a quick overview of sentiment trends.
Sample Data Summaries: Counts and sample sentences for each sentiment category offer insight into text patterns.
Usage
Environment Setup:
Create and activate a virtual environment.
Install dependencies: requests, spacy, spacytextblob, matplotlib.
Running the Analysis:
Run the main script to process and analyze sentiment in sample data or your own dataset.
Visualize polarity and subjectivity distributions to identify general sentiment trends.
Customization Options:
Export results to CSV for further exploration.
Expand to topic modeling, sentiment over time, and more for additional insights.
Example Output
Example polarity and subjectivity distributions show positive, neutral, and negative sentiment trends in the text, which can help inform decisions, track brand sentiment, or gauge audience reactions over time.

Further Extensions
The project is adaptable to include features such as:

Comparative Sentiment Analysis: Compare sentiment across datasets (e.g., reviews for different products).
Dashboard Creation: Use Streamlit or Plotly Dash to build an interactive interface for exploring the results.
Sentiment Trends Over Time: Analyze how sentiment changes over time for temporal datasets (e.g., news articles, social media posts).
